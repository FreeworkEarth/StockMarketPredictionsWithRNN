# StockMarketPredictionsWithRNN
The goal of this project was to predict stock market prices using a recurrent neural network. This project was inspired by the Standford paper found here -> https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH4PXH9O3UAhUd0IMKHfZSCVQQFggwMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcs229.stanford.edu%2Fproj2012%2FBernalFokPidaparthi-FinancialMarketTimeSeriesPredictionwithRecurrentNeural.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNF49SmA57kp2RPbTjdrBG5iFAvTig . Using the Standford paper as a baseline, I was able to improve and beat the accuracy of their model using hyper parameter tuning of my rnn network.
